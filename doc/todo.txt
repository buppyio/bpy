Alpha:

- Make browse ui more polished
- Write comprehensive man pages
- Make AddPack require a gc generation.

Bugs:

Cleanup open file descriptors on server disconnect.

Improvements:

- make 9p dynamically update
- Add gc tests for - dedup, removing stuff, repacking, concurrency
- Change fs api from "dest, src" to "src, dest", it is more natural since it works like mv or cp
- Rename cstore.Writer to just CStore
- Double check cstore memcache + mindex need to be string maps, and can't use arrays directly.
- Add tests for cstore that excercises packfile rotation
- Rename 'Pack' remote api to 'Stream'
- Implement hash split in htree
- Steal ideas like bloom filters, cstore is actually just an LSM.
- Only fetch changed indexes instead of reloading entire index when a lookup fails.
- Test every message type in proto packing/unpack tests
- Some clients are called store, this is incorrect.
