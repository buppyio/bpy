Improvements:

- Add gc tests for - dedup, removing stuff, repacking, concurrency
- Change fs api from "dest, src" to "src, dest", it is more natural since it works like mv or cp

- Double check cstore memcache + mindex need to be string maps, and can't use arrays directly.
- Add tests for cstore that excercises packfile rotation
- Rename 'Pack' remote api to 'Stream'
- Implement hash split in htree
- Steal ideas like bloom filters, cstore is actually just an LSM.
- Only fetch changed indexes instead of reloading entire index when a lookup fails.
- Test every message type in proto packing/unpack tests
