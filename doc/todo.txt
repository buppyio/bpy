- Give refs infinite history to allow error recovery
- Rename tags to refs or roots, make tags more like git tags
- Add command to merge small pack files
- Add command to migrate tags between key files
- Add tests for cstore that excercises packfile rotation
- Add client side chunk caching
- Write comprehensive man pages
- Add more user friendly failure messages for ssh failure (maybe use crypto/go ssh client)
- Rename 'Pack' remote api to 'Stream'
- Make browse ui polished
- Add signature to tags
- Add counter to tags which remote only allows to increment
