Alpha:

- Make put etc operate on a 'default' tag using cas
- Allow put to 'put' put files in addition to folders

Bugs:

- on windows when you init with no tags, a blank '.index' file appears in the local index cache.

Improvements:

- Delete old ebpack/tmp files on attach if they are older than some age
- Give refs infinite history to allow error recovery
- Rename tags to refs or roots, make tags more like git tags
- Add command to merge small pack files
- Add command to migrate tags between key files
- Add tests for cstore that excercises packfile rotation
- Add client side chunk caching
- Write comprehensive man pages
- Add more user friendly failure messages for ssh failure (maybe use crypto/go ssh client)
- Add download as zip/tar to browse ui
- Rename 'Pack' remote api to 'Stream'
- Make browse ui polished
- Add signature to tags
- Add counter to tags which remote only allows to increment
- Implement hash split in htree
- Test every message type in proto packing/unpack tests
- Combine cstore reader/writer so the can share a metaindex and half memory requirements
  of commands like put which do both.
- Steal ideas like bloom filters, cstore is actually just an LSM.
- Refetch meta index on lookup failure in case new packs have arrived.
